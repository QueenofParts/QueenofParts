--->Hi My name is Marnie and I am learning coding for the first time. I decided to do this course after a long, difficult time in my life caused me to experience a bewildering drop in self-confidence and I decided to do something really difficult, and do it well to rebuild my confidence and sense of self. 
I decided on the OSU AI Bootcamp as my confidence project. I must admit, after week one I have MANY questions and am aware of how much of a beginner I am at this.

My name above, is Queen of Parts because 22 years ago when I came to Ohio on a marriage visa, I had a long wait for a work permit.  Having come from working as a tech writer in the telecom industry, it was a shock to have no job or income.  Rather than wait, I slowly turned a cars/racing hobby into a parts business that now employs my entire immediate family.  See: www.Midwest-Bayless.com  We specialize in pats for vintage Italian sportscars.

I am a national level road racer in the Sports Car Club of America. I drive a 1980 Fiat X1/9 that is very modified for the track.  In 2016 I went to the National Championship at Mid-Ohio Sportscar course in my class, H Production.

I am also kind of a space geek.  Do you have a favorite NASA mission or other space related project?  I do!  Mine is the PSYCHE Mission which launched on 
10/12/2023. I have attended lectures about it and even flew to Florida for the launch, however it was delayed by a week, and I was unable to stay that long. 

I currently have 4 Volunteer gigs.  I drive the pace car in my region of the SCCA. I work at my local wildlife rescue.  I have qualified to get a rehabber's license in my state and will soon be qualified to work with rabies vector creatures like bats, racoons and skinks. I volunteer at an organization called Sheepdog Wolfhound which helps families, school districts and law enforcement protect minors from exploitation on the internet.  I also sit on the board of directors of a car club, Fiat Club of America.

Maybe this course will open more doors for me in the automotive industry! Or maybe it will bring some opportunities in a space related field. Perhaps I can use my newfound skills to solve problems for my family business or help any of my volunteer organizations. 

I am looking for new adventures every day!
