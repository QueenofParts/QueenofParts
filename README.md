--->Hi My name is Marnie and I am learning coding for the first time. I decided to do this course after a long, difficult time in my life caused me to experience a bewildering drop in self confidence and I decided to do something really difficult and do it well to rebuild my confidence and sense of self. 
I decided on the OSU AI Bootcamp as my confidence project. I must admit, after week one I have MANY questions and am aware of how much of a beginner I am at this.
My name above, is Quuen of Parts because 22 years ago when I came to Ohio on a marriage visa, I had a long wait for a work permit.  Having come from working as a tech writer in the telecom industry, it was a shock to have no job or income.  Rather than wait, I slowly turned a cars/racing hobby into a parts business that now employs my entire immediate family.  See: www.Midwest-Bayless.com  We specialize in pats for vintage Italian sportscars.
I am also a road racer in the Sports Car Club of America.  In 2016 I wnt to the National Championship in my class, H Production.
I am also kind of a space geek.  Do you have a favorite NASA mission or other space related project?  I do!  Mine is the PSYCHE Mission which launched on 
10/12/2023. I have attended lectures about it and even flew to Florida for the lauch, however the launch was delayed by a week and I was unable to stay that long. 
Maybe this course will open more doors for me in the automotive industry! Or maybe it will bring some opprtunities in a space related field...
I am looking for new adventures every day!
