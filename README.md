--->Hi My name is Marnie and I am learning coding for the first time. I decided to do this course after a long, difficult time in my life caused me to experience a bewildering drop in self-confidence and I decided to do something really difficult, and do it well to rebuild my confidence and sense of self. 
I decided on the OSU AI Bootcamp as my confidence project. I must admit, after week one I have MANY questions and am aware of how much of a beginner I am at this.

My name above, is Queen of Parts because 22 years ago when I came to Ohio on a marriage visa, I had a long wait for a work permit.  Having come from working as a tech writer in the telecom industry, it was a shock to have no job or income.  Rather than wait, I slowly turned a cars/racing hobby into a parts business that now employs my entire immediate family.  See: www.Midwest-Bayless.com  We specialize in pats for vintage Italian sportscars.

I am a national level road racer in the Sports Car Club of America. I drive a 1980 Fiat X1/9 that is very modified for the track.  In 2016 I went to the National Championship at Mid-Ohio Sportscar course in my class, H Production.

I am also kind of a space geek.  Do you have a favorite NASA mission or other space related project?  I do!  Mine is the PSYCHE Mission which launched on 
10/12/2023. I have attended lectures about it and even flew to Florida for the launch, however it was delayed by a week, and I was unable to stay that long. 

I currently have 4 Volunteer gigs:  
I drive the pace car in my region of the SCCA. This club is completely run by volunteers, without whom none of us could race! Thanks workers! 

I work at my local wildlife rescue.  In my work there I have qualified for a rehabber's license in my state and will soon be qualified to work with rabies vector creatures like bats, racoons and skinks. 

I volunteer at an organization called Sheepdog Wolfhound which helps families, school districts and law enforcement protect minors from exploitation on the internet.  Sometimes I work with families directly, or offer my business and financial experience to their directors.

I serve on the board of directors of a car club, Fiat Club of America. Here I offer business and financial advice. I have received the Helle Nice award twice from FCA for promoting women in racing. 

Maybe this course will open more doors for me in the automotive industry! Or maybe it will bring some opportunities in a space related field. Perhaps I can use my newfound skills to solve problems for my family business or help any of my volunteer organizations. 

I am looking for new adventures every day!
